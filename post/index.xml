      <description>CMS Open Data In a historic move, the CMS collaboration publicly released terabytes of their LHC data, available on the CERN Open Data Portal. Now anyone can play around with real collider data just a few years after it is collected. This is an amazing step by CMS, guaranteeing that data produced now will be valuable into the far future.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore that data. Using open data in our recent work has been exciting, educational, and frustrating.</description>

      <description>Classification at Colliders There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of recent interest in applying classification techniques from machine learning to particle physics. Methods from image recognition, natural language processing, and point cloud identification have outperformed expert-designed algorithms for a variety of collider tasks.
But there&amp;rsquo;s a problem: collisions at the LHC don&amp;rsquo;t come with labels. Unlike photos or handwritten digits, you can&amp;rsquo;t recruit an army of volunteers to see whether a Higgs boson was produced (before decaying) in a collision.</description>
