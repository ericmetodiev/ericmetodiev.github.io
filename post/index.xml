      <title>The Fractal Lives of Jets</title>

      <description>How a jet gets its shape Jets are sprays of particles emerging from high-energy particle collisions. They are ubiquitous at the LHC. But why do they exist and how do they form?
Protons are full of quarks and gluons. Naturally, their collisions give rise to many energetic quarks and gluons. We never see these in the detector, though. Instead, they undergo a multi-stage process to form jets of particles that we do observe.</description>

      <title>Adventures with Public Collider Data</title>

      <description>CMS Open Data In a historic move, the CMS collaboration publicly released terabytes of their LHC data, available on the CERN Open Data Portal. Now anyone can play around with real collider data just a few years after it is collected. This is an amazing step by CMS, guaranteeing that data produced now will be valuable into the far future.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore that data. Using open data in our recent work has been exciting, educational, and frustrating.</description>

      <title>Training Collider Classifiers on Real Data</title>

      <description>Classification at Colliders There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of recent interest in applying classification techniques from machine learning to particle physics. Methods from image recognition, natural language processing, and point cloud identification have outperformed expert-designed algorithms for a variety of collider tasks.
But there&amp;rsquo;s a problem: collisions at the LHC don&amp;rsquo;t come with labels. Unlike photos or handwritten digits, you can&amp;rsquo;t recruit an army of volunteers to see whether a Higgs boson was produced (before decaying) in a collision.</description>
